# crypto_info
This project is a crypto information website that uses ReactJS, MaterialUI, and Firebase for authentication and backend. The website has a table of all the crypto currencies in the home page and on clicking on any page it redirects to that crypto currency page having information about that currency and a chart of previous data of that currency using Chart.js. The website also has login options with email and password and Google login. After the user has logged in, they can add crypto currencies to their watchlist.
